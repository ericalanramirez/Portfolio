      <p> Since I can remember, there has always been a creative side to me. Art, photography, dance, music, film and fashion all firmly held my attention. <p>

After taking as many creative classes as possible in high school, I took things a step further and went to the Art Institute of Houston to study Visual Communications. There I was really able to hone my skills and learn theories and methods of communicating visually with an audience via text, graphics and images. <p>

Life has a way of changing directions and after the Art Institute, I ended up working for a travel agency for many years. I was however able to apply and use much of what I learned at the Art Institute in almost my daily work; designing brochures, client itineraries, flyers and even retouching photos.

After the travel agency I worked offshore on oil rigs around the world. That afforded me a little more practical design opportunities such as forms and even video production and editing! <p>

Long story short, I've always been able to be creative throughout my work history in some form or another. Not to mention always working on side projects such as club flyers, business cards, party invites and even some websites (using Adobe Muse) for friends and family. <p>

Unfortunately, the oil industry tanked (Did you see what I did there?) and I found myself in a very boring, unfulfilling hamster wheel in 2015. <p>

That sparked me to reinvestigate my love of creativity and how I could actually turn it into a career in today's market. Exhaustive research, recommendations and even some live, one on one interviews led me to UX/UI design! (Design Process much?) <p>

 So, here I am in New York City ready to use design as a way to engage, educate and enhance experiences across all platforms!
