    <p>Need to think of something catchy to put here.</p>

      <p> I am a HUGE Madonna fan. For my birthday a few years back, I literaly had a Madonna themed birthday party. All Madonna music, all night and  guests had to come dressed in thier best Madonna gear. <p>

The invite I designed below was created with Photoshop and Illustrator and printed in GetOut magazine. The design inspiration was that of the 80s club flyers posted around New York City by punk rock groups such as The Sex Pistols and XXXXXXXXX.<p>

Not only did my personal guest list come decked out but so did many other Madonna fans who saw the event ad!</p>
