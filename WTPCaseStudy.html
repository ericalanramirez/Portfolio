    <p>Welcome to Where's The Party! The easiest way to find your next good time!</p>
    <section>
      <h1>THE PROBLEM</h1>
      <h2>born out of need</h2>
      <p>Speed, simplicity, access and ease of use are all highly valued commodities in today's busy world. So is having a good time! But, finding where to go, what to do can be cumbersome. Having to depend on various searches, social media and word of mouth isn't simple or fast.

As a member of the LGBTQ community, I myself often find myself looking for events, parties and noticed that my friends did as well.

We all recognized the need for something better, simpler and faster than how we have been searching for parties and events.</p>

      <h1>THE SOLUTION</h1>
      <h2>problem solved</h2>
      <p>Where's The Party was born and geared to be a one stop shop for finding LGBTQ parties and events. A place to view event listings, photos, locations and even be able to read and write reviews.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <img src="img/Survey.jpg" alt="Keyboard Survey Button"/>
      <h1>User Surveys</h1>
      <h2>survey says...</h2>
      <p>The user survey really focused on how people search for events; what they like and don't like about that process.

The majorty found events on Facebook with the Scruff app and Gaycities app coming in second and third respectively.

Overwhelmingly, many found the process of looking for parties and events, long, tideous, difficult, lacking sufficient details and agreed that a one stop shop for all of this information would be useful.

      <h2>individuality is freedom</h2>
      <p> Data collected from the user surveys identified exactly who our target audience would be and helped define the User Personas.</p>

      <h1>USER STORIES</h1>
      <h2>whats your story?</h2>
      <p>Via the initial user survey it was clear what users were looking and what they would find helpful in app like this. This defined the MVP.
        <img src="img/UserStoriesWebCopy.jpeg" alt="User Stories"/>
As a user I want to...<br>
<br> VIEW EVENT LOCATIONS <br>
SEE PHOTS OF PAST EVENTS <br>
CLICK LINKS TO PURCHASE TICKETS <br>
READ DESCRIPTIONS OF EVENTS <br>
READ REVIEWS OF EVENTS

      <img src="img/UserflowWebCopy.png" alt="User Flow Image"/>
      <p>Let's make it as easy as possible for them to accees the information they want. User flows were created based on MVPs from the user stories.</p>

      <h1>SKETCHES & WIREFRAMES</h1>
      <h2>blueprints for success</h2>
      <p>With a firm grasp on who my users were and what they wanted, I got to sketching and and building two versions of premiliminary wireframes.
      <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/98bd359d-a675-42e1-810a-b288e91d37c5" class="button">View Version I</a>
      <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/84e71037-1d34-4386-9def-9e9d5f29e64e" class="button">View Version II</a>
      User testing and face to face interviews revealed that Version 1 of the the Wireframe was preferred due to less clicks, less scrolling and more precise and short bursts of essential information.</p>

      <h1>BRANDING & STYLE GUIDE</h1>
      <h2>present yourself to the world</h2>
      <img src="img/colorspectrumwebcopy.png" alt="Color Spectrum"/>
      <p>The Rainbow is known worldwide as an LGBTQ icon and data was collected that while it doesn't have to overwhelm a design, a nice "touch" is appreciated and recognized.</P>
      <img src="img/LGBTQ BrandingWebCopy.png" alt="LGBTQ Branding"/>
      <p>The idea of this app is to eventually highlight parties  and events in different cities as it expands. As an avid traveler my mind went to luggage tags and I wanted to mimic that in my design by using the bold three letter city codes.</p>
      <img src="img/AirportCodesWebCopy.jpeg" alt="LGBTQ Branding"/>
<p>Finally, since the process of finding events and parties had been less than fun before, I chose a font that was carefree and fun for the main title. No matter where you are when you pull up this app, you know you're in for a good time!</p>

      <h1>MOCKUPS</h1>
      <h2>seeing is believing</h2>
      <p>I designed high fidelity mockups in Adobe XD based on all the surveys and research collected and using the style guide that I created for this project.</p>

    <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
    <h2>long is the road from conception to completion</h2>
    <p>Working on this app was a long process but it gave me a new found appreciation for combining data, user wants and needs and delivering it all in a thoughtful and eyecatching design package that is functional and easy to use.

I learned that regardless of any preconcieved notions, that data is king and will truthfuly guide a design in the right direction, but only if you follow it!

Wheres the Party was merely an idea based out of a confirmed need. Through surveys, testing, sketching, wireframing and and prototyping (most times, more than once) it revealed itself and became reality.

The answers were all there, it was just my job to pay attention, collect and arrange them to  create something tangilbe that others can use.
